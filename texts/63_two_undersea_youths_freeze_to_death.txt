63. Two Undersea Youths Freeze to Death (Told by Herman James, September, 1958)


1.  maʔú pʰala men ʔama· ʔíhmi ʔa di·c̓iʔtíʔdam-.
1. This, too, is a true story that I am about to tell.

maʔú ṭ̓o kʰe ka·kánʔ dic̓i·duwa·dû.
My grandmother told this.

ʔahqʰa yów ʔbakʰe naṭa yya mí·meʔ^ mi· ʔaṭʰíʔ nohpʰow^.
Undersea youths were living there growing up.

Russian pʰiloloʔ meʔ^ qawi cila ʔíbâ c̓ašoṭ̓ó mal- nohpʰobâ mi·meʔ^ naṭá yya ʔul ʔahṭʰí· citiʔ^.
The Russians had landed a little earlier, and having lived there for ten years, the children had become big.


2.  mulido kú·yi- qʰos̓a· ʔihcʰe díbucem mi·meʔ^ ma·cáʔ ʔul s̓ihta boʔotí hšicʰmaʔ- s̓ihta k̓íli šihcimac̓ é· mû.
2. One time, when the winter rains were falling, [two youths] said that they would go hunting birds—what are named ‘black birds’ [=coot].

šóhqʰa tol ʔice·dû.
It was at Shohka.

mulido mi· ʔaha· cunaʔ tol mi·- mul ma·caʔ s̓íhta k̓ili ʔdo· duqʰaya·c̓iyiʔ men-.
Among the piled up driftwood, they had been accustomed to gathering coots [killed in the storms].

mulido ʔul mílhqʰaʔ da·bícʰqa· mi· baṭʰe· ʔi· šóc̓bâ.
They set out for that place, having heard that many were there. 

men cila dác̓qa· milhqʰaʔ^.
They traveled along towards there for a long time. 

mens̓iba baṭiw^.
Having done so, they camped.


3.  mulido miʔámhul ʔul- mi s̓íhta ʔiwal tiyaʔ duqʰaya·c̓iyi·c̓al i mílhqʰaʔ ʔul dac̓qaw~.
3. The next day they went towards the place where they customarily gathered the birds.

ʔahqʰa bahṭʰé hwoʔ- šóhqʰa wi- mu-.
High water was flowing at Shohka.

mulido ʔul s̓ihta baṭʰé· daʔt̓aw- duqʰayaʔ- mací hqʰowal duqʰayaʔ- síhcow- k̓aṭa hla· ṭ̓i· sicóʔ ma·cal^.
They found many birds and gathered them—all day long they gathered them. Their clothes got soaked all the way through.

yaláw ʔṭ̓o ʔdú·ciʔ tʰin- ʔahqʰa yó· hayoman ʔṭ̓o~.
At first they didn’t realize it, while they were wandering around in the wet.

mulido pʰiʔt̓an- duwéʔliʔli- ʔul ʔihcʰe díbucaʔ pʰala- mihsáʔ dibuʔ- maʔú ṭ̓o šiʔbá hla· ṭ̓i· síhcow-.
Suddenly, when dusk arrived, rain fell again—it rained heavily so that even their bodies were soaked.


4.  mulido ʔul "dalo·qóc̓qate· ya" nihcedu~ kú yaʔ^.
4. “Let’s climb up out,” said one. 

"yów" hcedu-.
“All right,” said [the other].

mulido ʔul qawi beṭi wiša· dalo·qóc̓qaʔli- pʰiʔt̓an šiʔba ʔel muʔs̓aṭáʔ min t̓a·du~ šicʰmaʔ^.
When they had got themselves a little way up out from there, unexpectedly their bodies felt numb, they said.

mens̓iba qawi da·bícʰqaba mi·^ qʰaʔbe híyeʔ- šuqʰaʔ^.
When they had gone on a little further, they sat down leaning against a rock.

mi· hihkoʔ^.
There they sat.

mulido cila ʔiba heʔen ma·cal tubíhciʔkʰe tʰin ciʔ^.
After a while, it got so that they couldn’t get up—

mihsáʔ min cʰit̓aʔ šahku ʔem-.
their legs felt rather heavy.

mulido· ʔan ʔihcʰe mihsáʔ dibuʔ- duweʔlíc̓ba-.
When it had become evening, the rains fell harder and harder.


5.  mulido s̓ihta k̓íli ṭ̓o baṭʰe· mišukʰ li- cisátʰmuʔ mi· baṭiw~.
5. They sat there like that at first. Many coots were lying there in the sacks they had been packing around.

mulido ku yaʔ- "heʔen íʔba ʔše· ya maʔal šiʔba tól dabo·c̓íʔbem ʔihṭʰe ʔel-" nihcedu~.
Then one said, “I wonder how it would be if we stuffed the feathers against our bodies.”

"cuʔdún ʔtʰin mens̓ipʰila ṭ̓o hoṭʰá·las̓uwem-" nihcedu bahṭʰe ʔem^.
Perhaps if we did that it would warm us up,” said the other one.

mulido mens̓iba "natíʔte· ya" cedu maʔú ʔul- s̓ihta k̓íli ʔel mul- mišúkʰ li šaʔahtalo·qoc̓in šuqa·tin- tiyá·col k̓aṭa qʰámʔli bawiliʔ^.
“Let’s try it,” he said. Taking th ecoots up out of the sak, they plucked them and stuffed them inside their clothes.

men báwiliʔ-.
They stuffed that way.


6.  ʔihcʰe ʔem ʔṭ̓o kumiʔdaʔ dibuʔ mihsaʔ^.
6. The rain pelted down steadily.

hebeṭi s̓uwaʔ ṭʰaʔbám tʰin ma·cal šiʔba tol ṭ̓i· síhcow^.
There wasn’t a dry spot on their bodies—they were all soaking wet.

mulido men híhkoʔ-.
They sat there like that.

men bawiliʔ-.
They stuffed like that.

ʔihṭʰe ʔél pʰala sihcoba baq̓o hoṭʰá·law ʔtʰin ma·cal^.
The feathers having got wet, they never warmed up.

miʔána· muc̓ehciw-.
?

ʔul duwe lébaṭʰe ciʔli-.
?

ná·qʰo šoʔk̓ó· tol- ciʔli ʔul- heʔen lowác̓kʰe tʰin ciʔ^.
At the stroke of twelve it got so that they couldn’t talk.

mulido ʔul- ku šóʔk̓o· tol- la·li ʔul kú ʔel pʰiʔt̓an soh cʰoyiʔ miṭiyiʔ ne·duʔ~ mu qahsilí· muʔc̓éc̓ba-.
Then, probably at one o’clock, one suddenly just died, fell over and lay there, having frozen stiff from the great cold.

mens̓i·li ku ʔém pʰala miqʰamá·to· mu pʰala cʰoyíc̓biw^.
The other one must have died soon afterwards.


7. mulido ʔul- cila k̓uwa·šaʔli "heʔén s̓iše· maʔu naṭa yya ʔdama·c̓ícʰqatem" nihciʔ- ʔahqʰa yów ʔbakʰe yacʰma-.
7. When they didn’t show up for a long time, the undersea people said, “I wonder why the boys haven’t come back.”

weʔé· ʔacaʔ nopʰotáʔli mi hla· k̓eša·c̓iwaʔ^.
They looked everywhere; even over where the Indians were living [apart from the Russian settlement].

ṭ̓i·ma· cadutaʔ^.
There was nothing.

cʰow^.
?

daʔt̓aw ʔtʰin^.
They didn’t find anything.

"weʔe· ʔašó ʔbas̓ide· kihlaʔ ʔi·" nihciʔ^.
“They must still be way off to the south,” they said.

"k̓eša·c̓íʔte· ya" nihciʔ maʔu ʔul^.
“Let’s go search.”


8.  mi·méʔ ṭ̓o ma·caʔ ṭ̓o kawa·yu ʔído· codotʰmuʔ ʔahqʰa yów ʔbakʰe yacʰma-.
8. At that time the undersea people road around on horses.

mulido ʔul- duwéʔli ʔul kawa·yu míhca wi- mi· codóhtac̓iʔ^ mílhqʰaʔ šóhqʰa wi tolhqʰaʔ^.
In the evening they rode off towards Shohka with four horses.

bahcil é· mi· tow^.
It was far from there.

mulido ʔul mi· codotaʔ~.
They rode along.

mens̓iba ʔul- weʔé· ma·caʔ ʔi· li yala· daʔt̓aw~ s̓ihta duqʰáyaʔ lî.
They found where [the youths] had been first—where they collected coots.

mens̓iba "heʔé· dac̓qaše·" nihcíc̓ba cila mi·^ cadutá·c̓iwaʔ^.
Saying “Where could they have gone?”

cila daʔt̓áw ʔtʰin^.
They didn’t find them.


9.  mulido ku yaʔ pʰiʔt̓an- haʔbeṭi qʰaʔbe híyeʔ- cadem "haʔu ṭa ʔiwám" ciʔ.
9. Then, suddenly, one person, on seeing them leaning against a rock, said, “There they are.”

yalaw ʔṭ̓o bahcilú· cac̓in s̓imún tac̓qabiw^.
He must have thought they were alive, seeing them at a distance at first.

mulido milhqʰaʔ codohtaqaʔli pʰiʔt̓an cʰóyʔtaʔ baṭiw~ qahsilí· muc̓ehciw^.
When they rode up towards there, suddenly they were lying there dead, frozen stiff from the bitter cold.

ʔaha· mín citiʔ muhqaw-.
They had become rigid like a stick.


10.  mulido maʔu ʔul kawa·yu tol náhtaqac̓ba ʔul ʔacal hqʰáʔ cʰiʔdicʰqaw^ ʔacaʔ qʰo· ʔí· men kawa·yu tol nemʔbâ.
10. Having put both of them up on horses, they led them off homewards. 

maʔu ʔul weʔe· ʔaca· new^.
Then they set them down at home.

pʰiʔt̓an naṭa yya ʔyowal cʰóyʔtaʔ new~.
Unexpectedly [to their mothers] they set down those dead youths.

miyá·ṭʰe yacʰma ʔana· ší·batʰya· pʰíʔt̓aqaʔ ší·batʰya· t̓ác̓qaw-.
Their mothers looked pitiful—they felt sad.

mens̓i·li cila mí· ʔiw^.
Subsequently they stayed there for a while.


11.  mul menin ma·caʔ qahsíl ʔama· winato· nihcíʔ ʔacaʔ yacʰma ṭ̓ô.
11. Because of that, the Indians said that cold was a terrible thing.

baṭʰe· šátʰqac̓inati kihlaʔ ʔacaʔ cʰoyí·c̓edu- ʔihcʰe wi sihcocí·dun^.
Even if he wore a lot of clothes, a person would die if he got drenched in the rain.

mú ʔeo·- "muʔs̓aṭáʔ men s̓ice·du- šíʔba ʔel bala· ʔihyumcime·dun-" nihciʔ maʔcaʔ^ ʔacaʔ yácʰmâ.
“When the body’s blood grows cold, one becomes numb,” said the Indians.

mens̓ín ma·caʔ ṭ̓o- buṭaqá ʔime ʔel ʔiyo· šátʰqac̓ba- heʔén ma·cal ʔṭ̓o qahsil- waláʔkʰe tʰin^.
They [Indians] wore a bear skin underneath so that they cold could not get in.

ʔihcʰé ʔnati sihṭʰólhmaʔkʰe tʰin mul- buṭaqá k̓aṭa ṭ̓o he· yahmóṭ̓ k̓aṭa- he· bihše k̓áṭa ʔe· ma·caʔ- yuhu méʔ qan ʔṭ̓o šátʰqaʔ^.
Even the rain couldn’t penetrate that bear skin or panther skin—or the buckskin that they wore in summer time.

menín ma·cal ʔṭ̓o bute· men heʔé· qahsili· šulamʔ tʰin ʔihcʰe dibuhca·natî ʔacaʔ yácʰma ya·col^.
That’s why the Indians never sickened from the great cold, even when the rain beat against them.

mulido men bahnataʔ^ heʔen ín ma·cal ʔṭ̓o mens̓icé·du tʰin.
[The Russian] asked why it didn’t happen to them [the Indians].

mens̓i·li mul dic̓waʔ^ ma·cal ʔahqʰa yów ʔbakʰe yacʰma ya·col^.
Then they told the undersea people.


12.  maʔú ʔe· ka·kanʔ to dic̓i·duwá·du mu pʰala ʔihmî.
12. This that my grandmother told me is also true; 

ti· cadu.
she saw it herself.

mu pʰala ti· dasá·la·li cadû ʔama· yo·^.
She also saw when they buried them in the ground.

mulido·- tiyaʔ dasa·law ʔwa·yi- weʔé· ʔaya·yóhca coʔdomac̓ba- 
Before they buried them, they had borne them into the church.

ʔul mi· ʔul doʔq̓óʔdic̓ba meʔ ʔul ʔama yo· dasa·law^ mul naṭa yya qʰo· qawiya yyâ.
Having prepared them, they set the two youths down into the ground.

maʔú ʔe· manʔ to ʔama· dic̓i·du ti· cadu~ tíʔkʰe huʔú· li cadu mu pʰala ʔíhmî.
This is what she told me herself—she saw with her own eyes—this is also true.

men é· manʔ to ʔama· dic̓í·duwa·du-.
That’s the way she told me the story.

baṭʰe· ʔa ʔdu·ciʔ to ʔama· ʔíhmi dic̓i·du-.
I know a lot of the true stories she told me.

maʔu ʔe· méʔpʰî.
This is the end.
